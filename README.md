# FastCardsOnline v0.0.0
A web application in Python/Flask that flexes simple OOP and data structures muscles to build an API that maintains decks of reviewable flashcards, in the browser.

## Dependencies:
- Flask (Python 3.4)
- sqlite3
- sqlalchemy

## Long term goals:
- The best parts of both Anki and Quizlet.
- Goal: to ease the study practice of _Active Review_ as advocated by Cal Newport over at the _Study Hacks_ blog. FastCards will use time-based algorithms to remind you _when_ to review _what_ subjects, every time you log in.
- Share decks with other users.
- LaTeX support for STEM students.
